- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I've got more confidence about working with flexbox and items positions. But the main learning was the form validation using JavaScript and regex.

### Continued development

To the next project, I will keep improving my JavaScript skills and the CSS grid, that an area that I need to work more with.
